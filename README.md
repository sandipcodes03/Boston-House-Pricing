# Boston-House-Pricing
This project explores predictive modeling on the Boston Housing dataset using a comprehensive machine learning pipeline. The framework integrates multiple regression techniques—including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor—to estimate the median value of homes. As part of a progression from intermediate to advanced model training, the project emphasizes data preprocessing, model training and testing, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. This comparative analysis not only highlights the strengths and trade-offs of each algorithm but also demonstrates the scalability and adaptability of a modular machine learning workflow.
